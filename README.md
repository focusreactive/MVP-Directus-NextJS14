# MVP Directus + NextJS14

The project is a Proof of Concept (POC) based on NextJS 14 as the front-end application and Directus as a Headless Content Management System (CMS).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, please follow the steps outlined below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by `yarn`.
3. Launch the development server by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn dev

```

## GraphQL Playground

As part of our offering, we provide a self-hosted GraphQL playground that allows you to inspect the GraphQL API and write queries. You can access the playground by clicking [here](https://focusreactive.com/embed/graphiql/?api=fr2Directus).

## Content Model

The project consists of two types of collections, which are as follows:

1. Products: This collection is utilized to store all the relevant information about the products.
2. Categories: This dynamic collection is employed to categorize the products. Each product should be associated with a specific category.

## Flows

The primary objective of this project is to test the functionality of Directus flows. To initiate the process, please start from the "Submit" page. On this page, you will find a form that allows you to add a new product. Once you have filled out the form, submitting it will trigger the submission flow, which will handle the request from your browser.
